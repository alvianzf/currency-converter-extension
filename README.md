# Currency Converter Chrome Extension 💰
*Because Googling exchange rates is just too much effort.*

## What is This?
This is a mind-blowing Chrome extension that converts currencies. You type a number, pick two currencies, and boom—magic happens. You get the converted amount. Revolutionary.

💡 *Why did I make this? Because opening a new tab and typing “1 USD to EUR” was just way too much effort.*

## 🚀 Features (If You Can Call Them That)
✅ 🔍 Searchable currency dropdowns – Because scrolling through 150 currencies is a special kind of torture.  
✅ 🔄 Uses a free API – So don't expect 100% accuracy, but hey, close enough.  
✅ 💼 LinkedIn & 🐙 GitHub Icons – Because what's an extension without shameless self-promotion?  
✅ 🎨 Stylish UI – Okay, it's just a couple of   buttons and a select box, but it has colors, so that's something.



## 📦 How to Install (If You Really Want To)
1. 📥 Download the Code – Or don't. Your life, your choices.
2. 🛠 Go to chrome://extensions/ – No, you can't just double-click a .zip file and expect it to work.
3. ⚡ Enable Developer Mode – Because Chrome doesn't trust you.
4. 📂 Click “Load Unpacked” – Select the folder where this masterpiece is saved.
5. 💰 Click the Extension Icon – If it doesn’t work, blame Chrome, not me.
6. 💡 How It Works (Like You Even Read This Section)
7. 🎤 Open the extension.
8. 🔢 Enter an amount (try using numbers, not emojis).
9. 💱 Pick two currencies (yes, you need to pick both).
10. ⚡ Click Convert.
11. 🎉 Marvel at the converted amount.





## 🙄 FAQ (Fine, I’ll Answer Your Questions)
❓ Q: Why is my conversion slightly off?  
👉 A: Because free APIs aren’t perfect, and neither is life.

❓ Q: Why isn’t my currency available?  
👉 A: Either the API doesn’t support it, or your country’s economy has collapsed. Who knows?

❓ Q: Can I customize the extension?  
👉 A: Sure, go ahead. But don’t expect a tutorial—figure it out.
